Summary of Header Reports

                               Internal Unique No., Institution Name, Ship Name,
                               Scientist, Report Number

Reference Header       B       Funding Code (2-digit internal funding code),
                               Project Code, Title of Report or Comments,
                               Units Codes.

Sample Header          C       Sample Identifier, device code, date of 
                               collection, time of collection, latitude,
                               longitude, water depth, core length, device

Cruise and Reference headers are coded once per cruise.  Sample headers are
coded once per station-sample (e.g. every time either a station or a sample
identifier changes or device type changes).

Analytical information is coded using the following record types:

     1) Interval header
     2) Optional comments record
     3) Data records

Each new interval within a core is noted with an "interval header," if a
subcore or replicate is analyzed, a new "interval header" is also coded.
Free-form comments applying to an interval, replicate, or subcore may be
entered following the "interval header" using a "comments" record type.

There are a large number of data record types.  The coder should select
only those types which apply to the analyses performed, and omit other 
data card types.

     Type of data provided for in this format include:

          grain size analyses - 02 record types
          geotechnical analyses - 08 record types
          geochemical analyses - 05 record types

A complete description of data entry formats for all of these types of 
information follows.


Common Fields
------ ------

For sorting and retrieval purposes, the following fields are common to, and
occupy the same columns within, the record types indicated:

interval#,                    interval, replicate, or subcore.
replicate#


Additional Information
---------- -----------

The basic unit of analysis for purposes of this format is the "replicate."
A replicate may, depending on the analytical methods, be equivalent to a core
interval or grab sample, or may be one of several sample splits.  In either
case, each replicate analyzed is represented in the data by an Interval Header
record followed by one or more data records.  If only one split was analyzed
for each sample, the replicate number will always be zero.  Fields which are
not applicable (such as subcore and interval number in the case of a grab
sample) are left blank.  Subcore numbers are used only for small cores or
spot samples extracted from box cores.  All weight percentage fields contain
two implied decimal places (no decimal points are coded).  Code "9999" for
100%, "0000" for trace (less than 0.005%).

All field lengths are in bytes.  A = Alpha or alphanumeric fields (left-
justified within field), 9 = Numeric fields (right-justified, balanced around
any implied decimal position), X = blank field.  ^ denoted an implied 
decimal position (99^99 is a four-digit numeric field with two implied
decimal places).
